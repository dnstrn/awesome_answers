  # CanCanCan automaticall integrates with ApplicationController and it assumes that you have a method in your ApplicationController called 'current_user'
  # You don'y need to automatically create an Ability object (automatically done)
  # We just need to learn how to write authorization rules and how to use them
  def initialize(user)

    # We instantiate the user to User.new to avoid having the user be nil if the user is not signed in. We assume here that 'user' will be 'User.new' if the user is not signed in.
    user ||= User.new

    # this gives superpowers to the admin user by having the ability to manage everything (all actions on all models)
    can :manage, :all if user.admin?

    alias_action :create, :read, :update, :destroy, :to => :crud

    # defining ability to :crud (do anything) with a question
    # in this case below we put inside the bloack an expression that will return true or false. This will determine whether the user is allowed to crud a question or not (create, read, update, destroy).
    can :crud, Question do |q|
      q.user == user && user.persisted? # <-- making sure is logged in by having user persisted (extra protection)
    end

    can :crud, Answer do |a|
      (a.question.user == user || a.user == user) && user.persisted?
    end

    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
    #   user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)
    #   if user.admin?
    #     can :manage, :all
    #   else
    #     can :read, :all
    #   end
    #
    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
